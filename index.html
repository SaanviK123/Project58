          <p>I love to read! Reading is AMAZING! I love it! If I get some time, I just grab a book and start reading! I just get lost in the story! My favorite authors are J.K. Rowling, Stuart Gibbs, and Tui. T. Sutherland! My favorite genres to read are mystery, suspense, and fantasy! Reading is so much fun and it is my favorite hobby!</p>
